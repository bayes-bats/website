Our goal is to advance **Ba**yesian **T**hinking in **S**TEM, hence the name **BATS**.

BATS is a three-tiered program

- The first tier of the program consists of a **week-long instructor training bootcamp** (on the west coast at University of California Irvine in Summer 2023, and on the east coast at Vassar College in Summer 2024), to build a diverse community of Bayesian educators across different STEM fields.

- In the second tier of the project, selected **instructors will develop Bayesian teaching and learning materials** specifically using scientific data from their fields with the support of the PIs, during the fall semester after their summer boot camp training participation. 

- In the third tier of the project, selected **instructors will disseminate the teaching and learning materials** through conferences and publications with the support of the PIs.

The BATS Project Objectives are as follows:

- Increase the number of undergraduate students who are exposed to Bayesian methods; 

- Enhance the capacity of STEM instructors in Bayesian methods through training and community building; 

- Develop and enrich teaching and learning materials that showcase use of Bayesian methods in STEM fields.
