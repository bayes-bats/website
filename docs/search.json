    "text": "Our goal is to advance Bayesian Thinking in STEM, hence the name BATS.\nBATS is a three-tiered program\n\nThe first tier of the program consists of a week-long instructor training bootcamp (on the west coast at University of California Irvine in Summer 2023, and on the east coast at Vassar College in Summer 2024), to build a diverse community of Bayesian educators across different STEM fields.\nIn the second tier of the project, selected instructors will develop Bayesian teaching and learning materials specifically using scientific data from their fields with the support of the PIs, during the fall semester after their summer boot camp training participation.\nIn the third tier of the project, selected instructors will disseminate the teaching and learning materials through conferences and publications with the support of the PIs.\n\n\nThe BATS Project Objectives are as follows:\n\nIncrease the number of undergraduate students who are exposed to Bayesian methods;\nEnhance the capacity of STEM instructors in Bayesian methods through training and community building;\nDevelop and enrich teaching and learning materials that showcase use of Bayesian methods in STEM fields.\n\n\nFunding\nBATS program is supported by NSF IUSE: EHR program with award numbers 2215879, 2215920, and 2215709."
