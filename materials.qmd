title: "Course Materials Development (Tier 2)"
---

## Description

About ten instructors **who attend the bootcamp** will be selected to develop course materials in the Fall semester. They will be engaged in a semester-long collaborative endeavor to develop teaching and learning materials of Bayesian methods for undergraduate students in their disciplines that are at public dissemination quality. Instructors of similar STEM disciplines will be teamed up, and each team is mentored by one of the PIs. Depending on the instructorâ€™s objective and their plan of introducing Bayesian methods in their undergraduate curriculum, we expect some to develop a **Bayesian module** to be part of an existing course while others to develop a **full Bayesian course** as part of their curriculum offerings. 

## Funding

Instructors selected to participate in course material development will be compensated with $1,500 each for their time and effort.  

## Application

All participants to the BATS Bootcamp in Summer 2023 can apply to Tier 2 by submitting the [Tier 2 Application form](https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bmvqDdmb5s0e8yq). The application closes on **Friday July 21**. If you submit multiple applications (accidentally, or because you made changes), the last application will be considered - if this is not desired, please contact Mine Dogucu at [mdogucu@uci.edu](mailto:mdogucu@uci.edu).
