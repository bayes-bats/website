title: "Course Materials Development (Tier 2)"
---

## Description

About ten instructors **who attend the bootcamp** will be selected to develop course materials in the Fall semester. They will be engaged in a semester-long collaborative endeavor to develop teaching and learning materials of Bayesian methods for undergraduate students in their disciplines that are at public dissemination quality. Instructors of similar STEM disciplines will be teamed up, and each team is mentored by one of the PIs. Depending on the instructorâ€™s objective and their plan of introducing Bayesian methods in their undergraduate curriculum, we expect some to develop a **Bayesian module** to be part of an existing course while others to develop a **full Bayesian course** as part of their curriculum offerings. 

## Funding

Instructors selected to participate in course material development will be compensated with $1,500 each for their time and effort.  

## Application

All participants in the BATS Bootcamp in Summer 2024 are eligible to apply to Tier 2 by an application. The application will be shared here at a later date. 

## Schedule

The schedule of Tier 2 activities for the 2023 cohort can be found at [this link](https://bayes-bats.github.io/tier2-schedule/).

## Example Course Materials

The following are teaching materials that former Tier 2 participants have developed. More will be shared.
