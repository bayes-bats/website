    "text": "Our goal is to advance Bayesian Thinking in STEM, hence the name BATS.\nBATS is a three-tiered program\n\nThe first tier of the program consists of a week-long instructor training bootcamp (on the west coast at University of California Irvine in Summer 2023, and on the east coast at Vassar College in Summer 2024), to build a diverse community of Bayesian educators across different STEM fields.\nIn the second tier of the project, selected instructors will develop Bayesian teaching and learning materials specifically using scientific data from their fields with the support of the PIs, during the fall semester after their summer boot camp training participation.\nIn the third tier of the project, selected instructors will disseminate the teaching and learning materials through conferences and publications with the support of the PIs.\n\n\nThe BATS Project Objectives are as follows:\n\nIncrease the number of undergraduate students who are exposed to Bayesian methods;\nEnhance the capacity of STEM instructors in Bayesian methods through training and community building;\nDevelop and enrich teaching and learning materials that showcase use of Bayesian methods in STEM fields."

    "section": "",
    "text": "About ten instructors who attend the bootcamp will be selected to develop course materials in the Fall semester. They will be engaged in a semester-long collaborative endeavor to develop teaching and learning materials of Bayesian methods for undergraduate students in their disciplines that are at public dissemination quality. Instructors of similar STEM disciplines will be teamed up, and each team is mentored by one of the PIs. Depending on the instructor’s objective and their plan of introducing Bayesian methods in their undergraduate curriculum, we expect some to develop a Bayesian module to be part of an existing course while others to develop a full Bayesian course as part of their curriculum offerings.\nInstructors selected to participate in course material development will be compensated with $1,500 each for their time and effort. More information on the selection process of the instructors will be shared at a later date."

We would like these resources to be adopted by their colleagues in their STEM fields.\nWe expect to support about five instructors each year in writing pedagogical papers and/or giving conference talks within their scientific discipline community, introducing their developed materials as well as discussing Bayesian pedagogy.\nWe expect these efforts to be aimed at more pedagogy-focused channels such as journals and conferences focusing on science education.\nInstructors selected for the dissemination group will be supported with $2,000 each to disseminate their work at national conferences and/or with open-access publications."
