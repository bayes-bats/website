title: "Dissemination (Tier 3)"
---

We would like the teaching materials developed by BATS instructors to reach a wider audience beyond their own students. We would like these resources to be adopted by their colleagues in their STEM fields. 

We expect to support about five instructors each year in writing pedagogical papers and/or giving conference talks within their scientific discipline community, introducing their developed materials as well as discussing Bayesian pedagogy. 

We expect these efforts to be aimed at more pedagogy-focused channels such as journals and conferences focusing on science education. 

Instructors selected for the dissemination group will be supported with $2,000 each to disseminate their work at national conferences and/or with open-access publications.
